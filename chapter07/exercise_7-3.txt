Provide named constants that you really can’t change the value of. Hint: You have
to add a member to Variable that distinguishes between constants and variables 
and check for it in set_value(). If you want to let the user define constants
(rather than just having pi and e defined as constants), you’ll have to add a 
notation to let the user express that, for example, const pi = 3.14;.
