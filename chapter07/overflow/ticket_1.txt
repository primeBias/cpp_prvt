Task:
	Implement division with precision to use doubles that are truncated after 
	`x` number of digits.

Solution:
	Convert the value types to double. This will cause each of the
	functions to have a small decimal value as per estimation 
	operations of doubles. Truncate each of these for `x` digits
	of precision and hope that it doesn't break. Create a function
	to truncate a double and return it, will this estimate the 
	double again and add some value? Check.
