Suggest an improvement and implement it:
	Allow for variable reassignment, be sure those variabls are not 
	constant.
0.5. create new function to set is_const to true called set_const.
1. Call set_value if is_declared is true in declare_const() and
	declaration() functions

	otherwise
	push_back the new variable

when x is declared as a const first, it can no longer be declared as 
another const or variable

when x is first declared as a variable then as a const, it can again
be changed.
